Patches for WIEN2k 21.1
-----------------------

- Place analyse_phonon_lapw.patch into $WIENROOT
- Apply the patch with: patch -b analyse_phonon_lapw analyse_phonon_lapw.patch
Description: Fix of WIEN2k PHONON for case.struct with precise positions.
Reference: https://www.mail-archive.com/wien@zeus.theochem.tuwien.ac.at/msg21376.html
 
- Place calLa_Pre_elast.patch into $WIENROOT/SRC_IRelast
- Apply the patch with: patch -b calLa_Pre_elast.f calLa_Pre_elast.patch
- Recompile: In ./siteconfig -> R Compile/Recompile -> S Select program -> IRelast
Description: This patch is under test for resolving the following error.  When running set_elast_pressure when WIEN2k was compiled with gfortran, an error may occur with the message:

At line 83 of file calLa_Pre_elast.f (unit = 10, file = 'case.outputeos')
Fortran runtime error: Constant string in input format
(' V0,B(GPa),BP,E0',3f15.4,f18.6)

It seems that the ifort compiler allows constants in the input format (i.e.,' V0,B(GPa),BP,E0') while the gfortran compiler does not. Therefore, the generic character format needs to be used for both compilers (i.e., 16x).
